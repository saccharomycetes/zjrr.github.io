    <h4 class="text-center">Annotation Procedure</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In each example, you are given a video in a traffic scene. (see example below)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Carefully watch the video.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Then you are given 3 questions, which ask you about the initial scene, detailed movement, and the final scene of the video.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Follow the question to give a detailed description of the video.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-center">Key Advices</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Include as many relavant participants as possible. (Including the pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Include as many relavant environments as possible. (Including the traffic situation nearby, )</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Include as many details of movements in the video as possible. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Try to use specific names. Rather than "the car", you should use "The SUV, the sedan, the tricycle(see in example).</strong></li>

        <li><strong><font color="#FF0000">Do not</font> use pronoun. (In every sentence, you should use "the car", "the vehicle" rather than
                "it")</strong></li>
        <li><strong><font color="#FF0000">Do not</font> use negative sentences. (Rather than "the car does not move", you should say "the car
                stays still.")</strong></li>
    </ul>
