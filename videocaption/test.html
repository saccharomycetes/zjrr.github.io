                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Include all important participants in the video. (Including the pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic lights)</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Include as many details of movements in the video as possible. </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Try to use specific names. Rather than "a car", you should use "an SUV, a sedan, a tricycle."</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>If the car in the first persective is involved in the traffic event and you can not recogize the car, you may use "a car".</strong></li>
                
                        <li><strong><font color="#FF0000">Do not</font> use pronouns. (In every sentence, you should rephrase the participants rather than "it")</strong></li>
                        <li><strong><font color="#FF0000">Do not</font> use negative sentences. (Rather than "the car does not move", you should say "the car
